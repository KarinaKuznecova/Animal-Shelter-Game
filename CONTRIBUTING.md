Hi :)
Thank you for contributing, I'm always happy when someone is interested in my project. 

You are here for tips, right? So here they are.


<b>I want to help, where to start?</b>

I labeled issues, so it is easier to choose your first task. You might want to start with something labeled "good first issue". 

If you have questions - feel free to ask. If you don't understand something, but really want to help - ask. I'm friendly, I promise :)



<b>Found a bug!</b>

Check existing issues, maybe it is already reported. If you have any new information about bug - add comment.

Found new bug? Create an issue, describe exactly how to reproduce, add screenshots if applicable, add label bug.


<b>I have really cool idea</b>

Create an issue with label 'idea' and describe everything in details. 


<b>I want to work on new feature, but don't agree with solution</b>

Leave a comment, let's discuss


<b>Any general coding tips?</b>

Yes. 
Create new branch, would be great if it will have issue number in the name. Good examples: issue54, issue61-changing-zoom.

Avoid unnecessary comments, use meaningfull method and variables names instead. 

Add logs where it makes sense. 

Pay attention to formatting. If you use Intellij IDEA, just press ctrl+alt+L. 

Do you have SonarLint plugin? Highly recommend to install it. Check that you didn't create new issues.

Don't create big changes in small tasks or unrelated changes. For example, if you are fixing how animal is walking, don't touch map saving functionality.

Small refactoring is ok. Big refactoring should be done only in scope of technical issue. Not sure? Ask.


Ask yourself: 

Does this method belong to this class? 

Will other people understand what is happening here? 

If someone will want to find this functionality, what he will type in search and will he find it?


But don't be too hard on yourself. It works? It is readable? Great.

Don't forget about meaningfull commit message.


<b>Good luck!</b>
