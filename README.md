Currently there are 9 locations and you can walk accross them. You can build on all locations and save your progress to a file (**press F5**). There are no resources limit yet. You can have different animal by spawning them manually or by finding them in a chest. There is a chance that NPC will come to your main map and ask to adopt a random animal. You can accept or decline. If you accept - they will go away together and NPC will leave you random item. 

You can grow food :) To plant something - **press P**. When it is fully grown - you can pick it up and item will go to your inventory. 

**Press B** to open your Bag. Collected item will appear in your bag. You can select item and place it somewhere in the worlds. You can also pick it back.

## Plans for future

It is supposed to become a nice game, where you rescue animals(mini-quests), they live with you in your animal shelter and some animals can help you build your base/home, because some builds will requere resources and effort. 
Sometimes you will have visitors, who would make donations(resources) or/and adopt animals from you.
