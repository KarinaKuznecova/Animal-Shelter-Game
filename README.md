Currently there are 9 locations and you can walk accross them. You can build on all locations and save your progress to a file (ctrl+s). There are no resources limit yet. Each location can have animals, there are 6 animal types now. 

You can grow food, but can't pick up yet :) To plant something - press P.

Press H to teleport to first location.

Press 0 to open menu for adding new animals. On the right side you will see all your animals on current map. Limit is 10. To remove animal - pick its portrait from right menu and press DELETE. 

Press Q to hide/show all buttons. 

Press ESC to show/hide all these tips

## Plans for future

It is supposed to become a nice game, where you rescue animals(mini-quests), they live with you in your animal shelter and some animals can help you build your base/home, because some builds will requere resources and effort. 
Sometimes you will have visitors, who would make donations(resources) or/and adopt animals from you. You will be able to choose which animal is available for adoption and which animal you will leave for yourself.
